		descriptions:
			'1. Subjects of Political Analysis. The subjects of political analysis can only be groups of people or individual analysts. 2. Objects of Political Analysis. The object of political analysis is what is being researched. In politics, the objects of analysis can be: 1. Political systems. The structure of the state, balance of power, democratic and authoritarian regimes are analyzed. 2. Political processes. Elections, decision-making, and implementation of government programs are analyzed. 3. Political actors. These can be political parties, leaders, social groups, or international organizations. 4. Political culture and ideology. The values, beliefs, and behaviors of various political groups are analyzed. 5. Conflicts and crises. The objects can be armed conflicts, social crises, and international confrontations. 3. Challenges in defining the real object of analysis. Defining the object of political analysis is not always obvious. In complex political situations, analysts may face several problems: 1. Multiplicity of interests and opinions. In politics, there are many actors, each with their own interests. This creates complexity in choosing the object of analysis, as it is often necessary to consider all sides of the conflict or political process. 2. Difficulty in distinguishing causes and effects. It is often difficult to determine what is the cause and what is the effect in the political process. 3. Problems of data interpretation. Even with reliable data, its interpretation may be difficult. 4. Changes in political context. The political situation may change rapidly, complicating the identification of the object of analysis in the long term. 5. Ideological bias. Analysts may be influenced by their political preferences or interests, which interferes with objectively evaluating the objects of analysis.',

			'Main types of political processes: 1. Institutional processes: These processes include changes in political institutions such as parliament, courts, and executive power. 2. Socio-political processes: Social processes include growth in political awareness, mobilization of civil society, and changes in political culture. 3. Economic-political processes: Economic processes play an important role in political life. 4. International political processes: International processes influence global relations between states. Main types of political events: 1. Elections. 2. Political crises: Political crises can be caused by protests, coups, or revolutions. 3. International events: International events include conflicts, wars, treaties, and agreements. 4. Political assassinations and terrorist acts: Political assassinations or terrorist acts can drastically change the political landscape. The complexity of separating political processes and events: Separating political processes and events is a complex task, as they are closely intertwined in reality. Political processes are long-term and sustainable changes in political, economic, or social systems, while events usually represent short-term, specific moments or actions that can have a significant impact on the course of history. However, it is often difficult to draw a clear line between these two concepts, as one event can become a catalyst for a long-term process, or a long-term process can lead to the emergence of many events.',

These sources have not yet undergone interpretation or analysis by other researchers. 1.2. Secondary sources are interpretations and analyses based on primary data, prepared by researchers or analysts. These sources include expert opinions, studies, and reports that interpret primary information. 1.3. Tertiary sources are summarized and systematized data, such as media, encyclopedias, reference books, or databases that collect and organize information from primary and secondary sources. 2. Information processing technologies 2.1. "Data verification" is the process of checking the authenticity, reliability, and accuracy of received information. In political analysis, this is critically important to avoid disinformation and manipulation. 2.2. "Data visualization" is the process of presenting information in a graphical or visual form, which helps to perceive complex data faster and better. The use of diagrams, graphs, maps, and infographics significantly simplifies the perception of political information. 2.3. Problems of information perception arise as a result of cognitive distortions, misrepresentation of data, or bias. People tend to perceive information depending on its context and presentation format. 2.4. Classification and structuring of information is the process of organizing data into ordered categories and hierarchies, which allows for systematic and efficient analysis. 2.5. Analytical models are techniques based on the use of mathematical and statistical tools to predict political and economic events. 2.6 For OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) analysis, there are a number of specialized programs and tools that help collect, analyze, and visualize information from open sources.

			'Methods of Political Analysis: Logical Analysis and Matrix Approach.',
		descriptions:
			'There are many methods of political analysis, which can be divided into several key groups: 1. "Historical Method" — analysis of political events and processes through their historical development, which allows for understanding long-term trends and recurring patterns. 2. "Comparative Method" — a method based on the comparison of political systems, institutions, and processes in different countries or time periods to identify their characteristics and patterns. 3. "Systematic Method" — viewing political phenomena as parts of broader systems (for example, the political system as part of the social system) and studying the interrelationships between these parts. 4. "Logical Method" — analyzing cause-and-effect relationships between political phenomena and processes using the laws of logic to identify dependencies and construct arguments. 5. "Matrix Method" — structuring and comparing a variety of factors in the form of a table (matrix), which allows considering their impact on political decisions and outcomes. 6. "Sociological Method" — studying political processes through the lens of public opinion, social groups, and institutions using sociological surveys and statistical data. 7. "Cognitive Method" — studying political processes through the perception and thinking of political actors, analyzing their goals, beliefs, and decisions. 8. "Mathematical and Statistical Methods" — using quantitative data and mathematical models to analyze political processes, such as electoral behavior or resource distribution. "Logical analysis" is best suited for cases where it is necessary to trace a chain of events and identify key factors influencing the situation. "Matrix analysis" is useful when several factors and their interrelationships need to be considered simultaneously. It helps compare alternative scenarios and make decisions based on complex interconnections.',

		descriptions:
			'1. The systematic method of analysis involves viewing political phenomena as complex systems consisting of interconnected elements. This approach is based on the general systems theory developed by Ludwig von Bertalanffy in the mid-20th century and applies the principles of systems thinking to the study of political processes. 2. The situational method of analysis focuses on specific circumstances, context, and unique factors that influence political decisions and events. This approach is based on the understanding that each political phenomenon occurs in a specific temporal and spatial context, which significantly affects its development and outcome. 3. Induction in political analysis is a logical method in which general conclusions or theories are drawn from observations of individual cases. In political analysis, the inductive method involves collecting empirical data and identifying patterns that can be generalized into broader principles or theories. 4. Deduction in political analysis is a logical method in which conclusions are drawn by applying general principles or theories to specific cases. In political analysis, the deductive method involves using existing theories or models to explain or predict specific political phenomena.',

		descriptions:
			'"Political modeling" is the process of creating a simplified mathematical or conceptual model of political reality to analyze political processes and forecast outcomes. Models can be statistical, game-based, or simulations, and are used to understand how various factors (such as economic conditions, elite actions, public opinion) influence political behavior. "Thought experiment" is an analytical technique that uses imagined situations to test hypotheses or analyze political problems. Unlike empirical research, which requires the collection of real data, a thought experiment is based on assumptions and hypothetical outcomes. It allows the researcher to model situations that are impossible or undesirable to replicate in real life. Key differences: - "Abstractness vs. Concreteness." A thought experiment involves more abstract thinking, while political modeling requires precise data and the construction of formalized systems. - "Qualitative vs. Quantitative analysis." A thought experiment is geared toward qualitative analysis (moral, ethical, hypothetical issues), while modeling often uses quantitative data. - "Flexibility vs. Formality." A thought experiment can be a free interpretation of a situation, while political modeling is constrained by strict parameters and methods. Lecturer - Ruslan Bortnik.',

		title: 'The Use of the Comparative Method in Political Analysis.',
		descriptions:
			'Practical recommendations for using the comparative method: 1. Clear definition of the research goal: before starting comparative analysis, it is necessary to define the goal. For example, you may want to determine how differences in electoral systems affect the level of political stability. In this case, you will compare countries with different electoral systems (e.g., majoritarian and proportional) and assess their political stability. 2. Selection of objects for comparison: the objects must be relevant to the study. It is incorrect to compare completely incomparable political systems (e.g., an absolute monarchy with a liberal democracy) if the goal is to study specific aspects of democracy. Instead, it is better to choose similar democratic systems with variability in one of the key parameters, such as the form of government (presidential vs. parliamentary democracy). 3. Collection of data from reliable sources: the comparative method requires the use of both quantitative and qualitative data. It is important to rely on verified sources such as statistical data, reports from international organizations, and academic studies to avoid bias and incorrect conclusions. 4. Control of external factors: during the comparison process, it is important to consider external factors that may distort the results. For example, when comparing the level of political stability in two countries, it is important to consider economic conditions, cultural differences, and the influence of international actors. 5. Interpretation of data considering context: when analyzing data, it is important to take into account the political, economic, and cultural contexts of the compared countries. For example, differences in economic policy may result not only from the political system but also from the historical development of the countries. Lecturer - Ruslan Bortnik.',

		descriptions:
			'Expert surveys are an important method of obtaining knowledge and forecasts in political analysis. Unlike mass public opinion polls, which collect data from a wide sample of the population, expert surveys focus on the opinions and assessments of a narrow group of specialists. 1. The essence of expert surveys Expert surveys are a method of collecting information based on the opinions and assessments of a group of experts. These surveys are usually conducted among specialists in a specific field, such as political science, international relations, economics, sociology, or law. The main goal of an expert survey is to obtain a well-founded opinion on issues where public opinion may be insufficiently informed or unbalanced. Expert surveys are important for analyzing political situations, predicting future events, and evaluating the effectiveness of political decisions. 2. The process of conducting expert surveys The process of conducting expert surveys includes several stages: - Selection of experts. This is a key point, as the importance and authority of the results depend on the competence of the selected specialists.

		descriptions:
			"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is actively being implemented in various fields, including politics, which requires a deep understanding of not only the possibilities but also the risks of its application. Political analysis is an area where AI can be used to analyze big data, predict voter behavior, study political rhetoric, and identify propaganda and manipulation. However, questions arise regarding AI auditing, ensuring its transparency, and combating bias. 1. Predicting political events using AI. AI can be used to predict election outcomes, protest movements, international conflicts, and economic sanctions. This is done through the analysis of big data, including historical data, social and economic indicators, information from media and social networks. Specific mechanisms: 1. 'Machine learning for electoral data analysis' - GPTs: 2. 'Neural networks for predicting election outcomes': 3. 'Social behavior analysis': 2. AI for rhetoric and propaganda analysis. AI is actively used to analyze political rhetoric, identify bias, and propaganda. Text and speech analysis allows for the detection of hidden motives and possible manipulations. Specific mechanisms: 1. 'Natural Language Processing (NLP) for political rhetoric analysis'. 2. 'Network narrative analysis'. 3. 'Countering disinformation and fake news'.",

		descriptions:
			'Logical synthesis is a method based on collecting, analyzing, and integrating various aspects of information to create a holistic understanding of complex political phenomena. It uses logical operations and methods to combine data, facts, and concepts to identify patterns, predict the development of events, and formulate conclusions. Main principles of logical synthesis in political analysis: 1. Systematic approach to analysis 2. Logical operations and analysis methods Errors in applying logical synthesis 1. Ignoring context; 2. Misinterpretation of data; 3. Excessive generalization; 4. Insufficient hypothesis testing; 5. Lack of diversity in information sources; 6. Ignoring alternative explanations; 7. Problems with logical coherence; 8. Neglecting qualitative aspects.',
