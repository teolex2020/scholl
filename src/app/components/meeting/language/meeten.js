Additionally, the expert will discuss: 🔹 Types of Ukrainian banks (business banks, retail banks for the 'ordinary citizen', scheme-based laundering banks, oligarchic banks, etc.) and their hidden mechanisms of operation. 🔹 How banks generate record-breaking profits since Ukraine’s independence and whether this 'shiny display' of the banking system is real. 🔹 Basic skills for reading financial statements, allowing you to assess a financial institution’s solvency, detect suspicious transactions, and determine whether a bank’s profits or losses are genuine or fictitious. ****🔹 How to assess a bank’s reliability?— What financial indicators are crucial to analyze?— How to distinguish real losses from artificial write-offs?— Which banks are potentially problematic, and how can this be identified? 🔹 State regulation: who controls the banks?— The role of the NBU and other financial regulators.— Why do some banks 'survive' while others are suddenly liquidated?— How does the state influence the banking sector, and what reforms are currently being discussed? 🔹 The future of Ukraine’s banking system.— What changes are expected in the market in the coming years?— What is the likelihood of new banking crises?
